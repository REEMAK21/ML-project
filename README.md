# Data EDA + ML

This project is part of a **milestone in the AI Professionals Bootcamp**. It focuses on **Machine Learning ML**,
**pipelines**, data manipulation with **pandas**, visualization, and developing analytical skills including storytelling from data insights.

---

## Project Overview

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Extract**: Load raw Data  
2. **EDA**: Clean, normalize, and enrich the data
3. ML steps

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+  
- Git installed  
- (Recommended) Virtual environment support
- uv
  
> **Note:** All commands assume you are in the project root directory (`week3-ml-baseline-system`) and the `.venv` is active.

---
## Setup
week2-data-work> python -m venv .venv

# activate venv

-#Windows (PowerShell)#:
python -m venv venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

-#Mac / Linux:#:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## EDA
Open notebooks/Shipping_Crisis_Template.ipynb  and run all cells.
> **Note:** Before running the cells, make sure to select the kernel corresponding to your .venv virtual environment. This ensures all dependencies are available.
